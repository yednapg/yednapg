I spend most of my time thinking about making something creative with Machine Learning & Web. I write on my [Blog]() mainly on Machine Learning, AI and Research. You can Contact me through [E-Mail]() or DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/)! Be nice, and I promise I'll get back to you.

You can find me on the Internet by [@](https://www.google.com/search?q=%40), I care deeply about the Worlds Climatic change and solving daily life problems using Artificial Intelligence.
